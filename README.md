# Hi there, I'm Artur Mamedov 👋

**`Developer | Tutor | Creator`**

Versatile web developer with 15+ years: full-stack dev PHP/JS, WordPress expert, custom MVC/Laravel/ReactJS/NodeJS/API/PayPal/AWS/OpenAI/Anthropic. Nothing stops me!

I am a full-stack web engineer with a strong self-taught background and over 15 years of hands-on experience building real-world products. I work daily with PHP, JavaScript, WordPress, and custom CMS solutions, always focusing on performance, UX, SEO, and business impact.

I have designed and maintained MVC/HMVC modular architectures, APIs, payment systems, and analytics dashboards, managing projects end-to-end from front-end to back-end. I am comfortable deploying and maintaining infrastructure on AWS and VPS environments, handling servers, integrations, and production workflows.

In recent years, I have focused on modern, business-driven solutions: React-based booking widgets, AI integrations (OpenAI, Anthropic) for intelligent automation and translations, and revenue analytics dashboards using the Cloudbeds API for the hospitality industry.

I work fast, independently, and strategically. I do not just write code—I solve problems, anticipate risks, and deliver solutions that create real value.
